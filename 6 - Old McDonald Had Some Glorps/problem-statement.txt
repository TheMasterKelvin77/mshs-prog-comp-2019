This problem was written by David McKnight.

Farmer Hjalmar McDonald is doing his yearly Glorp planting, but has forgotten the arrangement from the year before. For those who didn’t pay attention in Glorps 101, Glorps are highly valuable plants that, if planted too close to one another, will eat each other when they have grown. Old Man Hjalmar obviously would like to avoid this, and has asked you to check his proposed new arrangement.

Input Format

The input for this problem consists of a number N on the first line where N is the number of glorps on the farm. The next N lines contain coordinates xi yi where Hjalmar proposes planting his Glorps. Your job is to determine, given these proposed locations, whether Hjalmar’s plants will all be safe (or whether they’ll eat each other!). To be safe, plants must be more than 1 unit apart from each other. All numbers given will be non-negative and will be storable as doubles.

Constraints

All values will fall within the range for ints/doubles/floats. Longs or BigNums are not necessary.

Output Format

"Safe!" for each planting arrangement that resorts in no glorps eating each other; "Unsafe!" for each arrangement that does.
